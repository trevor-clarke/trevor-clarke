## Summary

The "15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership" is a guide to becoming a more conscious leader. The authors present 15 commitments that leaders can make to shift their mindset and behaviors towards conscious leadership. These commitments cover a wide range of topics, from taking radical responsibility to speaking candidly, eliminating gossip, practicing integrity, and experiencing the world as an ally.

## Take-Aways

### Commitment 1: Taking Radical Responsibility

- “The alternative is to say, “I [We] messed up,” and though some think this is taking responsibility, it is still based in blame and leaves a negative residue. In fact, often when we start working with leaders, they understand rather quickly that blaming others is poor leadership. But since they still believe that the world isn’t the way it should be, they resort to blaming themselves and end up modeling self-blame for others. We want to be very clear: self-blame is equally as toxic as blaming others, or circumstances, and it is NOT taking responsibility.”
- “But do a thought experiment with us. What if there is no way the world should be and no way the world shouldn’t be? What if the world just shows up the way the world shows up? What if the great opportunity of life isn’t in trying to get the world to be a certain way, but rather in learning from whatever the world gives us? What if curiosity and learning are really the big game, not being right about how things should be? Can you see how this would radically change the way we see and live our lives? What if the big questions of life were not “How can we fix this?” or “How can we keep this from happening?” or “Who’s to blame for this being this way?” but instead “What can we learn from this since life is all about learning and growing?” Or “Hmm… I wonder what this is here to teach me about myself and life?”

### Commitment 2: Learning Through Curiosity

- No notes

### Commitment 3: Feeling All Feelings

- **Note:** I am not fully understanding the part about sexual flow.

### Commitment 4: Speaking Candidly

- "In powerful committed relationships, where both parties share a commitment to candor and deep listening, we encourage a practice of revealing judgments. The key is that we reveal our judgments so that we can make ourselves known. We don’t reveal our judgments to be RIGHT or to change the other person. In other words, when I reveal my thoughts and feelings I’m telling you about me, not about you."
- "If we all speak candidly and don’t withhold facts, thoughts, feelings, or sensations, it greatly increases the probability that collectively we can see reality more accurately."
- "Three types of reveals are unarguable: a thought, a feeling, or a sensation. By unarguable, we simply mean that people can’t argue with it."
- Here are three forms of unarguable communication:
  1. I’m having the thought that…
  2. I feel… [sad, scared, angry, joyful, or sexual].
  3. I’m having a body sensation of… [pinching in my shoulder blades, swirling in my belly, throbbing in my temples].
- "One final point about candor. At any particular time, leaders are operating from either fear or love. This is simple yet profoundly true. Underneath all withholds is fear. We choose to withhold because we’re afraid of losing approval, control, or security."
- "Rather, speaking from love asks this question: 'How do I say all my truth in the most loving way possible?"

### Commitment 11: Sourcing Approval, Control, and Security

- “The issue is “wanting” approval, control and security. As soon as we want something, anything, it implies that we don’t have it. Wanting comes from a belief in lack. I can only want what I believe I don’t already have. Wanting approval, control and security implies that I don’t already have them. Wanting says I don’t have it and I need to go outside of myself to get it. This belief in lack can be found at the root of all suffering and the cause of all seeking.”
- “ Hale is, “You cannot go anywhere to get what you already have and you cannot do anything to become what you already are.”
- "“Those who believe they lack move in the world from fear and those who believe they are already whole, perfect, and complete, lacking nothing, move in the world from love and creativity.”

### Commitment 12: Having enough of everything

- “She goes on to explain the three truths of sufficiency: (1) money is like water—regardless of the flow, you direct where it goes; (2) what you appreciate, appreciates; and (3) collaboration creates prosperity. We highly recommend The Soul of Money”
- “To experience the shift from scarcity to sufficiency in this moment—since sufficiency is a state of being, not just a data point—we recommend doing this meditation:
  Check in this moment to see what your experience is right now. In this moment, allow yourself to take a few deep breaths. Notice the air moving in and out of your lungs. And notice the breath that sustains you. And that there is enough.
  And bring your attention to your physical body. Pay attention to any sensations. Notice what is. See if there is anything lacking. Check to see in this moment right now what your experience is. As you breathe in, notice the wholeness of your physicality.
  In this moment now, notice your experience of time. Notice that there is no past and no future. There is only now. The past is behind and the future is ahead. In this now moment, what is your relationship with time? Notice that the edges of time begin to blur as now refreshes itself with each moment. Always now. And check to see in this now moment if you have enough time.
  As you continue this exercise, bring to your mind anything you have been believing is scarce, that you don’t have enough of. And check in this now moment if anything is missing. Or if you have everything you need, neither excess nor scarcity.
  Notice that when you are fully present in this now moment, you have plenty of everything. Everything is perfect. Because it just is. To experience scarcity, you must be outside yourself and the present moment—anticipating the lack of something in the future or harboring the lack of something from the past. When there is just now, there is always enough.”

### Commitment 13: Experiencing the World as an Ally

- “Other people don’t even have to consciously commit to being your ally. If you are committed to experiencing them that way, they are always instrumental to your growth.”

### Commitment 14: Being the Change

- Doing the "how am I" questions would be a good exercise for me to do on my own. Perhaps I am doing the behaviors I am “observing” others to have.
- "We accomplish this by listing our beliefs and complaints about others and then asking ourselves, 'How is this true about me? How am I not facing this in myself?'"
- Is the fact that we are observing the behavior in someone else an indication that we might be doing that behavior ourselves? Or is this more of a general method and approach to become more aware of our own actions? It seems like the book is implying that our judgments of others might actually be a direct indication of our own flaws. Is this correlation or causation?
