## My Thoughts

Overall, I really enjoyed this book. There is something about its small form-factor, cute illustrations, and colorful language that makes this book fun to read. 
Being a highly creative person, I often feel like the world is attempting to stifle my ideas and expression. This book attempted to explain how to get past that and, in the process, provided comfort by explaining that I am not alone in this endeavor.

## Minuses

While the general ideas presented in this book were valuable, I prefer more actionable advice when it comes to topics like these, where the author is specifically attempting to solve a particular problem, rather than generalized suggestions. I understand that the author attempts to explain this shortcoming by stating, "every person's situation is different," but I believe this is a poor justification.
