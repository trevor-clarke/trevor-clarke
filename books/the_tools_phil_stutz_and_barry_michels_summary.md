To some degree, these tools are all basically saying "don't \_\_\_, just do the opposite." For example, "Don't feel anger, just feel love." The strategies seem really powerful upon reading, but I find myself wondering if there's a limit.

When I read self-help books like this, I'm acutely aware that almost every self-help book undermines the value of "previous" self-help books, trying to explain why this one is different.

It makes me question if reading these is helpful.
However, I think they are, so I'll keep reading them.
The idea of 'you on your deathbed' yelling at yourself to do more now is both really dark and incredibly powerful. It reminds me of this philosophical excerpt in the middle of some pop song:

> Excerpt from GFY by Dennis Lloyd
>
> When you think back on your life
>
> And you're 95, a hundred years old
>
> And you look back over the course of your lifetime
>
> You're not going to think
>
> I wish I owned a better phone
>
> I wish I spent more time on the internet
>
> I wish I spent more time at work or sleeping
>
> It's not going to be any of those kinds of things
>
> It's going to be, I wish I spent more time with the people I love

For me, this is incredibly powerful.

Circling back to what I mentioned above—about "can it just be that simple" (just don't be angry)... The answer might truly be yes. It can be that simple. We do spend so much of our time worrying, being mad, being angry—but for what? What do we actually get out of doing that?

Reading this also reminded me of two "conclusions" that I've come to over the past little bit:

Life is just long enough for us to forget that today actually matters.
This was almost directly stated in the text:
For most of us, the truth—that every moment counts—is too much pressure to bear.

Read from your own perspective: Just because you're making a mistake, doesn't mean that I'm not.
