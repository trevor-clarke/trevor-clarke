## Brain thinking dump

- To some degree these tools are.. all basically saying "dont \_\_\_\_ just do the opposite"... eg: <br> Don't feel anger, just feel love.<br> And reading the strategies they do seem really powerful.. but I do find myself wondering if there is a limit

- When I read self-help books like this, I am acutely aware that almost every self help book puts down the value of "previous" self-help books... and tries to explain why this one is different.

  - It kinda makes me ask myself if reading these are helpful
  - I think they are, so I will keep reading them

- Using 'you on your deathbed' yelling at yourself to do more now is both really fucking dark, but also super powerful. It reminds me of this philisophical exerpt in the middle of some pop song...

  > <b>Exerpt from GFY by Dennis Lloyd</b> > <br> When you think back on your life
  > <br> And you're 95, a hundred years old
  > <br> And you look back over the course of your lifetime
  > <br> You're not gonna think
  > <br> I wish I owned a better phone
  > <br> I wish I spent more time on the internet
  > <br> I wish I spent more time at work or sleeing
  > <br> It's not gonna be any of those kinds of things
  > <br> It's gonna be, I wish I spent more time with the people I love

  And, for me -- this is super powerful.

  Circling back to what I mentioned above -- about "can it just be that simple" (just don't be angry)... The answer might truly be Yes. It can be that simple. We do spend so much of our time worrying, being mad, being angry -- but for what? What do actually get out of doing that.

- Reading this also reminded me of two "conclusions" that I've kinda come to over the past little bit:

  - Life is just long enough for us to forget that today actually matters.

    - This was almost directly stated in the text:
      > For most of us, the truth – that every moment counts – is too much pressure to bear.

  - Read from your own perspective: Just because you're making a mistake, doesn't mean that I'm not.
