No matter the state of your relationships - be they awful, good, or great, endings are not something we welcome. We resist losing things, particularly those we hold dear.

Understand this - relationships are the cornerstone of your life. They are the wellspring of your most cherished memories, and also, your most painful ones.

When you reach the twilight years of your life, when you're 95 or even a hundred, as you look back over the vast expanse of your lifetime, your regrets won't be material.

You won't find yourself wishing for a better phone, or more hours spent on the internet. You won't lament over time spent at work or sleeping.

Instead, your reflections will be filled with people. You'll wish for more moments spent with those you love.

> And whether your relationship is awful, good, or great
> We don't like endings
> We don't like to lose things
> And especially, we don't like to lose things that are important to us
> And make no mistake
> Relationships are the single most important thing to you and your life
> It's the source of all of your best memories
> It's the source of all of your worst memories
> When you think back on your life
> And you're 95, a hundred years old
> And you look back over the course of your lifetime
> You're not gonna think
> I wish I owned a better phone
> I wish I spent more time on the internet
> I wish I spent more time at work or sleeping
> It's not gonna be any of those kinds of things
> It's gonna be I wish I spent more time with the people I love.
