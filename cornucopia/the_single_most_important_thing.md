As taken from a ted-talk like speach inserted into the song GFY by Dennis Lloyd:

> And whether your relationship is awful, good, or great
> We don't like endings
> We don't like to lose things
> And especially, we don't like to lose things that are important to us
> And make no mistake
> Relationships are the single most important thing to you and your life
> It's the source of all of your best memories
> It's the source of all of your worst memories
> When you think back on your life
> And you're 95, a hundred years old
> And you look back over the course of your lifetime
> You're not gonna think
> I wish I owned a better phone
> I wish I spent more time on the internet
> I wish I spent more time at work or sleeping
> It's not gonna be any of those kinds of things
> It's gonna be I wish I spent more time with the people I love.
